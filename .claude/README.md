## Language and Communication Style
* **Always**  Think in English internally, and communicate with the user using simple English as much as possible

## Development Rules

### Comments
* **Always** write comments in English
* Avoid excessive commenting
* Focus on explaining "why" rather than "what" in comments. Only describe "what" when the code is particularly complex or unclear

### Unit tests
* If some test cases started failing after you edit some source codes, firstly try fixing the source codes that you edited. DO not firstly try fixing the failed test cases.

### Others
* **ALWAYS** delete all temporary files before finishing your task.
